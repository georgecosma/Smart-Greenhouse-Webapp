# Smart Greenhouse Webapp

This code is part of my project named "Smart Greenhouse". It is the source code for the Web Interface responsible for displaying the live data received from the physical greenhouse system such as:luminosity, temperature and soilmoisture but also sending commands to the greenhouse modules: water pumps, air vent or fans.
